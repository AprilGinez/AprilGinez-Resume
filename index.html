        <p class="lead mb-4">I am the captain of Universal Movement, the hip hop dance team at my school. I joined the dance team as a freshman and have been in it ever since. The faces and number of members varies within each new school year, members ranging from twenty to forty and from all grade levels. I have made it a priority of mine to personally get to know and be comfortable around each and every member because I believe it is important for a dance team to have a close bond. Throughout the years, I have created choreography for my team and taught them step by step. These choreography are showcased at our dance concerts and dance showcases which is how we get recognition from our school. I became the person on the team that members comfortably went to for advice and support even before I received the position as captain. Whenever there was any confusion, I would be the one to step up and guide them.<br><br>

        Every year members who are new or beginning dancers start off with a lack of confidence when dancing because learning choreography can be difficult at first. To confront this situation, I teach multiple dances at different levels that allow the members to learn new dance moves and different styles of dance. By coordinating this repetition of dance classes, the moves became more natural to them giving the members a sense of accomplishment and an increase in their confidence not only in dance but in themselves. I also give the members a choreography project which requires them to make their own choreography, allowing members to open up their creativity and develop a series of dance moves. Communication is important when you are a leader of a dance team. My responsibility regarding communication within my team is to lay out my expectations of the team, the daily schedule of our week, and answering any questions that my team member have for me. I am responsible with updating our dance teacher about our progress and the daily attendance of team. My responsibilities include making and organizing a year schedule that includes the practices that correspond to the dance concerts and showcase that we perform in<br><br>

        Universal Movement have their very own showcases that we operate. The showcase is composed of the performances made by our own members. I am in charge of overseeing the whole production and making sure everyone has their dances, music cut and cleaned and etc. From leading my team I have improved my communication skills, organization skills and learned to handle situations more quickly. I have established a diligent, hard working environment in addition to a fun and happy atmosphere in the team. I only want the best for my team so I start to steadily increase the expectations for the team The only way to improve is to push yourself and to continuously set higher goals each time you accomplish one. I am very passionate about dance and my team members and I lead the team with this passion. My hard working attitude and dedication reflects positively onto my members.
